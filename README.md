# Arian Ventura Rodriguez

#### Software Engineer

### About me:

I am a backend developer with extensive experience using Python and its most popular frameworks, such as Django, FastAPI and Flask. I have worked on projects that require the development of tests with unittest and pytest, as well as the design and implementation of architectures oriented to microservices. Additionally, I have advanced knowledge of infrastructure as code, using Terraform and creating custom plugins for this tool. I have also used GitHub Actions to automate continuous integration and delivery processes, and have deployed applications to Kubernetes, using Helm Charts and Nginx as a load balancer. I consider myself a committed, creative and quality-oriented professional.
